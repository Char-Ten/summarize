Kanna Kamui (Miss Kobayashi's Dragon Maid) MMD
Modeled by icemega5

Her jacket is a tricky thing to work with. I created some adjustment bones so incase there's some disgusting clipping or bad weights, use those to adjust them.

What I forbid:

Do not sell this model for profit. It is only use for fan-art and nothing else
Do not use this model for commercial purpose
Do not claim this model as your own
No re-distribution

-----

Use my work responsibly. I can not be held responsible for any damages caused by this model.

Exceptions:

You may edit & take parts from Kanna. However, distribution of parts from this model is sololy forbidden.

Credit me as icemega5 if you are going to use this model.
